# aq-proto2
All scripts used to calibrate and analyze preliminary low-cost air quality sensor data. 

Most analysis done with Proto2; Proto2 was deployed at Queens from May 2021 to May 2022, recording CO, NO, NO2, O3, pm25, temperature, and RH data 

Data were then calibrated using various scripts that utilized mutiple linear regressions techniques fitted against a reference instrument 

Analyses of calibration performance were then conducted utilizing metrics such as r-squared, slope, RMSE, etc.

Purpose of these results was to develop techniques and procedures for low cost air quality sensor calibration and performance
